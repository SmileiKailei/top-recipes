            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 cups diced butternut squash</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
                    <li>1 pound potato gnocchi</li>
                    <li>1/3 cup chopped fresh sage leaves</li>
                    <li>5 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
                    <li>Kosher salt and pepper, to taste</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Directions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Roast the squash. Preheat oven to 425F. In a large mixing bowl toss the butternut squash with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Spread evenly on an aluminum-foil-lined baking sheet. Roast until tender and lightly browned, about 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Cook the pancetta. In a medium sauté pan over medium heat, cook the pancetta until most of the fat has rendered and the pancetta is brown and crisp, about 10 minutes. Remove from the pan and drain on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
                    <li>Boil the gnocchi. Bring a large pot of water to the boil; add the salt and bring back to the boil. Pour in the gnocchi and cook, until they rise to the top, about 3 minutes. Drain the gnocchi and return to the pot</li>
                    <li>Make the brown butter. Return the medium sauté pan to the heat over medium. Add the butter and allow to melt. Once melted add the sage then continue to cook the butter, swirling it around the pan occasionally, until the butter is toasty-brown color and has a nutty aroma. Once this happens immediately remove the brown butter to a small bowl. Set the sage aside on a plate.</li>
                    <li>Assemble and serve. Pour the brown butter over the gnocchi, stirring to combine. Add the butternut squash and pancetta and stir again, then season with salt and pepper. Top with the sage and finish with a squeeze of the lemon juice. Serve in warmed pasta bowls.</li>
